    question: "What is Abundance?",
    answer:
      'Abundance is a modern, browser-based 3D CAD application built with React and the replicad CAD library. It provides a node-based visual programming interface where designs are composed of interconnected "Atoms" (basic operations) and "Molecules" (reusable components). Projects are automatically version-controlled through GitHub, making collaboration natural and integrated.',
  },
  {
    question: "Where are my designs and projects stored?",
    answer:
      "All your designs and projects in Abundance are automatically stored as GitHub repositories in your account. This means you get real version control, history, and collaboration features for free.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I open or create a new design?",
    answer:
      "After logging in, you can create a new project (design), which creates a corresponding GitHub repository, or open existing projects from your list of repositories.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I collaborate with others on my designs?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Others can fork your project repository and make their own changes. We haven't yet added pull request built in features or branching but we will in the future.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does saving work? Do I need to save my work manually?",
    answer:
      "Your work is synced with your connected GitHub repository. There is an auto-save feature that saves every 5 minutes, or you can manually save your work using the 'Save' button or Ctrl+S.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I access my designs later or on another device?",
    answer:
      "Simply log in to Abundance again using your GitHub account. All your projects will be available through the project/repository browser.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import files or export my designs?",
    answer:
      "You can import or export designs using the 'Import' or 'Export' options in the interface. Supported formats are SVG, STL, and STEP for import, and STL and SVG for export.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there templates or sample projects to learn from?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Look for a 'Gallery,' 'Templates,' or 'Examples' section after you log in, where you can browse public projects or clone them to your own account.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I report a bug or make a feature request?",
    answer: "Open an issue on the Abundance GitHub repository",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why does the app seem slow when loading or rendering complex designs?",
    answer:
      "Abundance uses advanced 3D geometry calculations in the browser, which can be resource-intensive. Very complex models or slow devices may result in longer load or processing times. We are working to make it faster and more reliable.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What should I do if I encounter errors or something doesn’t load?",
    answer:
      "Try refreshing the browser page, ensure your internet connection is stable, and use a supported, up-to-date browser. If the problem continues, check your GitHub repository for errors and report the issue if needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to update anything manually?",
    answer:
      "No manual updates are needed—Abundance deploys updates automatically. If you see unexpected behavior, try clearing your browser cache or reloading the page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I go for more help?",
    answer:
      "Use the user-guide documentation, or tutorials. You can also visit the Abundance GitHub repository or community forums if available. Go to the Abundance Questions forum to ask questions and get support.",
